**Mobile Phones Analysis Project**
This project showcases an in-depth analysis of mobile phone data using SQL, Excel, and Power BI. The project was focused on understanding phone specifications, price patterns, and brand performance across various countries.

**Problem Statement:**
The mobile phone market is highly competitive, with numerous brands offering a wide range of products with varying features and prices. Understanding the dynamics of this market—such as which brands dominate specific price ranges, how different operating systems perform, and which features (like 5G and battery capacity) impact pricing—is crucial for both consumers and businesses.

This project aims to analyze mobile phone data to uncover patterns in pricing, storage capacity, operating systems, 5G availability, and brand performance across different countries. By leveraging data cleaning, SQL queries, and Power BI visualizations, the project seeks to provide actionable insights into:

Which brands offer the best value for money?

What are the most common features in different price ranges?

How do brands and their phone models differ in terms of key features like battery capacity, camera resolution, and 5G support?

What is the price distribution of phones by brand and operating system, and which phones provide the highest price-to-performance ratio?
