**‚≠êMobile Phones Analysis Project**
This project showcases an in-depth analysis of mobile phone data using SQL, Excel, and Power BI. The project was focused on understanding phone specifications, price patterns, and brand performance across various countries.

**‚≠êProblem Statement:**
The mobile phone market is highly competitive, with numerous brands offering a wide range of products with varying features and prices. Understanding the dynamics of this market‚Äîsuch as which brands dominate specific price ranges, how different operating systems perform, and which features (like 5G and battery capacity) impact pricing‚Äîis crucial for both consumers and businesses.

This project aims to analyze mobile phone data to uncover patterns in pricing, storage capacity, operating systems, 5G availability, and brand performance across different countries. By leveraging data cleaning, SQL queries, and Power BI visualizations, the project seeks to provide actionable insights into:

‚û°Which brands offer the best value for money?

‚û°What are the most common features in different price ranges?

‚û°How do brands and their phone models differ in terms of key features like battery capacity, camera resolution, and 5G support?

‚û°What is the price distribution of phones by brand and operating system, and which phones provide the highest price-to-performance ratio?


**‚≠êProject Overview**

üìΩProject Overview:
In this project, I conducted an end-to-end data analysis on mobile phone specifications using a dataset with columns such as Phone_name, Brands, Price, Internal_Storage, Operating_System_Type, USB_Type, 5G_Availability, and more. The project was executed in three phases:

üëâData Cleaning: Cleaned and prepared the data using hashtag#Excel.

üëâData Analysis: Leveraged hashtag#SQL to perform complex queries for insightful analysis.

üëâData Visualization: Imported the SQL queries into hashtag#Power BI to create an interactive dashboard for visual insights.


**‚≠êTools Used:**

‚û°Excel: Data cleaning and preparation

‚û°SQL: Writing queries to analyze data

‚û°Power BI: Dashboard creation for data visualization


**üéñKey Achievements:**

**‚ú®SQL Queries for Analysis:**

‚ô¶Calculated the total transaction amount for each brand.

‚ô¶Identified the top 3 most expensive phones by operating system.

‚ô¶Analyzed the percentage of phones with 128 GB internal storage that support 5G.

‚ô¶Found brands with the highest average battery capacity for phones with selfie cameras above 16 MP.


**‚ú®Power BI Visualizations:**

‚ô¶ Visualized the average price and count of phones by brands.

‚ô¶Showed the distribution of phone variants by internal storage and price range.

‚ô¶Compared the availability of 5G across different brands and countries.

‚ô¶Created charts highlighting key metrics like operating systems used by phones and brands offering most variants.
